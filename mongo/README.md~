These instances of mongo are already configured to work in the "sysdist"
replicaSet.

When deploying, pay attention to the hostnames. In each machine, edit
/etc/hosts to add each VM's IP to the list of known hosts.

Also, in one of them, run $ mongo and:

$ rs.initiate()
$ rs.add("host2")
$ ...
$ rs.add("hostN")

The hosts will be added and the replicaSet will configurate itself, choosing
a Primary. It can take some time.

Results of the configuration can be checked with rs.status() and rs.conf()
